🧹 Data Cleaning Task (Excel)
This repository documents the steps I followed to clean and transform a raw dataset using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

📁 Project Overview
The main objective of this task was to clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis by applying standard data cleaning techniques such as trimming spaces, correcting text formats, converting data types, and creating new calculated columns.

✅ Cleaning Steps Performed
Loaded Data and Promoted Headers

Loaded the raw dataset and promoted the first row to become the header row.

Trimmed Leading/Trailing Spaces

Removed unnecessary white spaces from all text fields using Excel's TRIM() function.

Capitalized Words

Standardized text columns by capitalizing the first letter of each word (e.g., category names, product descriptions).

Changed Data Types

Converted columns to the appropriate data types, such as:

Text ➝ Date

Text ➝ Number

Removed Unnecessary Columns

Deleted irrelevant or redundant columns to reduce dataset complexity.

Renamed Columns

Updated column names for better readability and clarity.

Created a Custom Column: Total Price

Added a new column calculating total price = Quantity × Price.

Converted Values to Whole Numbers

Ensured all numerical values (where appropriate) are stored as whole numbers.

Added Total Title Column

Created a new column labeled with a static "Total" text for reporting/labeling purposes.

Reviewed Cleaned Data

Conducted a final review of the cleaned data to ensure consistency and correctness.

Replaced Inconsistent Category Values

For example: replaced 'Accs' with 'Accessories'.

Final Formatting and Adjustments

Applied additional formatting and multiple replacements to finalize the cleaned dataset.
